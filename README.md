Text data can be found in various places and one of the first place we can think of is the internet. Other places include text messages, 
emails, tweets, product reviews, social media pages like LinkedIn and Facebook, webpages, customer service logs, product descriptions,
reference manuals, news articles, magazine articles, books, documents one can search for school or work activities. Text is virtually
everywhere.
In the data science world, text comes in an unstructured way meaning it is subject to analyses. Text can be summarised to yield certain 
statistics or features such as containing common words. Those features are then useful in applying machine learning models. Tweets 
Classification is one such model, and the sentiments expressed by tweets can be classified as 'negative' or 'positive'. Furthermore, text 
analytics can provide interesting results when building intelligent applications for example.

The following files (tweets.csv and stopwords.csv) were used to run a text experiment on Azure Machine Learning. There's no ensuing 
predictive experiment.
